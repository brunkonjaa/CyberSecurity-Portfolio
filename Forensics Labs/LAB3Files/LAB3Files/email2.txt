Professor,

After considering your request in detail, I find that a longer school
day would be beneficial to the students of 2016. I do not believe it
would be an honest test to include the other classes at this time. You
have my blessing to extend the school day by one hour, to 1620.  Good
luck in your endeavors.  Fair winds and following seas and all that
jazz.

       R/
       CAPT T. Kirk
